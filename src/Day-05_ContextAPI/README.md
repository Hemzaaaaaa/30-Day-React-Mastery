# ðŸš€ Day 5: React Context API - Solving Prop Drilling

## ðŸ“Œ What You Will Learn Today

Today, we are diving into the **React Context API**, a built-in way to manage **global state** efficiently without passing props manually through multiple components (**prop drilling**).

### ðŸ”¥ **Key Concepts Covered:**

âœ… What **Context API** is and why we need it.  
âœ… The **prop drilling problem** and how Context API solves it.  
âœ… How to create a **Context Provider and Consumer**.  
âœ… Using **`useContext()`** to access shared state.  
âœ… A practical example: **Theme Toggle App using Context API**.

## ðŸ”¹ **Summary of Key Concepts**

ðŸ”¸ **Prop Drilling Problem:** Passing props through multiple components can make the code **messy and hard to maintain**.  
ðŸ”¸ **Context API:** A global state management tool that allows you to **share state without passing props manually**.  
ðŸ”¸ **`createContext()` & `useContext()`**: Used to create and consume global state efficiently.  
ðŸ”¸ **Provider Component:** Wraps the app and provides the state.  
ðŸ”¸ **Consumer Component (`useContext`)**: Accesses the state from the provider.

## ðŸ›  **Mini Project: Theme Toggle App**

Today, you will build a **Theme Toggle App**, where users can **switch between light mode and dark mode** using Context API.
