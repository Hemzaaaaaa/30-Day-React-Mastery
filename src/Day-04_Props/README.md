# ðŸš€ Day 4: Understanding Props & Prop Drilling  

## ðŸ“Œ What You Will Learn Today  
Today, we focus on **props** in React, a key concept for passing data between components.  
You will learn:  
âœ… What **props** are and how they work.  
âœ… The difference between **props and state**.  
âœ… The **prop drilling** problem and why it matters.  
âœ… A practical example: **To-Do List using props**.  
âœ… A preview of the **Context API** to fix deep prop drilling issues.  


## ðŸ”¹ Summary of Key Concepts  
âœ… **Props** (short for properties) allow components to receive data from their parent.  
âœ… **Props are read-only** â€“ they cannot be modified by the child component.  
âœ… **Prop drilling** occurs when props are passed through multiple components, making code harder to manage.  
âœ… **Solution Preview:** The **Context API** (covered in a later lesson) helps reduce prop drilling.  


## ðŸ›  Mini Project: To-Do List  
Today, you will build a **simple To-Do List** where:  
- The parent component **manages the tasks** (state).  
- The child component **displays tasks using props**.  

This project helps you understand **how to pass and use props effectively**.  


## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next?  
Tomorrow, we will explore **React Context API** to solve the **prop drilling problem**!
